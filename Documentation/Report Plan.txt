chapter 1
benefits of application vs manual approach

chapter 2
describe about things learned on work placement that were implemented here - product backlog type document (with priorities), commiting each item to source control, having production and uat databases, weekly reviews with manager,  etc 

chapter 3 technical issues.
designing database
storing decision trees
creating decision tree interface
deployment issues
integrating unit tests
handling numeric attributes
--could explain scripting the databases to see if there were any differences between them

chapter 4
Describe the whole product, complete with screenshots and stuff. 
	detail deployment
	success of tree editor approach
	discuss how it could be used in a real life scenario
	describe how flexible it is to change
---Can mention fact that if there is a typo in an attribute, it can be edited without affecting any other attributes
---Can mention that when something looks good clients and users are more likely to think it is done well or whatever
---mention code refactoring, such as renaming stuff, seperating data layer from logic layer, 
---mention source control was useful with packages and renaming stuff
---mention prduct management, i.e. keeping track of requirements using excel spreadsheet
---software used: text-compare.com (when comparing create and edit views, which had to be similar), notepad++
---describe learning about naming things, how you should keep the names as similar to what you would use to clients

chapter 5. 

How close application is ready for production, i.e. account management, email system, bascically requirements that are left to be completed
what this means for the company or whatever 
--maybe say you could have implemented source control better by using branches
conclusion
