chapter 1
benefits of application vs manual approach

chapter 2
describe about things learned on work placement that were implemented here - product backlog type document (with priorities), commiting each item to source control, having production and uat databases, weekly reviews with manager,  etc 

chapter 3 technical issues.
designing database
storing decision trees
creating decision tree interface
deployment issues
integrating unit tests
handling numeric attributes
--could explain scripting the databases to see if there were any differences between them

chapter 4
Describe the whole product, complete with screenshots and stuff. 
	detail deployment
	success of tree editor approach
	discuss how it could be used in a real life scenario
	describe how flexible it is to change
---Can mention fact that if there is a typo in an attribute, it can be edited without affecting any other attributes
---Can mention that when something looks good clients and users are more likely to think it is done well or whatever
---mention code refactoring, such as renaming stuff, seperating data layer from logic layer, 
---mention source control was useful with packages and renaming stuff
---mention prduct management, i.e. keeping track of requirements using excel spreadsheet
---software used: text-compare.com (when comparing create and edit views, which had to be similar), notepad++

chapter 5. 

How close application is ready for production, i.e. account management, email system, bascically requirements that are left to be completed
what this means for the company or whatever 
--maybe say you could have implemented source control better by using branches
conclusion
