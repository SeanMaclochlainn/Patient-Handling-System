# Patient-Handling-System

Final year project

The main part of this application is the decision tree editor. This allows decision trees to be created, which then generate a different patient handling plan, or "solution" for each patient, based on their attributes and the attributes of equipment in the facility. Essentially, the program will iterate through a particular tree, using the patient and equipment attributes to guide it to a leaf, or solution node. 

The rest of the application consists mainly of CRUD operations for patients, patient attributes, and equipment.
