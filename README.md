# Patient-Handling-System

Final year project

The main part of this application is the decision tree editor. This allows decision trees to be created, which then generate a different patient handling plan, or "solution" for each patient, based on their attributes. Essentially, the program will iterate through a particular tree, using the patients attributes to guide it to a leaf, or solution node. 

The rest of the application consists mainly of CRUD operations for patients, patient attributes, and equipment. 

The decision tree editor is soon to be compatible with equipment attributes as nodes.
